        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Here is some information about me.</p>
        <p>Hi! My name is Ellie Oswald. I am a freshman at URI majoring in Computer Science possibly concentrating in Web Development. I am from Burke, Virginia which is 30 minutes from D.C. I am interested in programming because I love how we have the ability to code to create so many things. Prior to college I have learned a little bit of HTML, C#, and Python.</p>
